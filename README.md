# Bobble.ai Android Internship Challenge.
I was tasked to create an app with an option to display text entered by the user like a
threaded conversation.

There should be an option for the user to enter some text and a display/send button
beside it

Once the user enters the text and press the display button, the text should be displayed
as a list above the text input box like a threaded conversation(latest should be at the
bottom).

If the user press and hold the display button, then entered text should keep on increasing
in size (animations can be shown for the same on the screen- watch bigmouji video),

When the user releases the button it should be displayed in the appropriate size selected
by the user and input field should be blank.

Also when the user closes and reopens the app, previous data should be shown(Think
about user experience if the data is too much).

I made a threaded chat application much like WhatsApp. Users can send the text, hold the send button to enlarge the text and send it.
It uses Firebase's Realtime Db as it's backend.
Before sending texts the user has to register to the app using an unique username and password and login using that to start texting.
